# intern_resume_screening

This project is an AI-powered Resume Screening App that helps recruiters parse resumes, extract key information, and rank candidates against job descriptions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).

The system automates the recruitment workflow by reducing manual effort and providing data-driven candidate shortlisting.
